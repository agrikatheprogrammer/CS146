In class, we briefly discussed that Merge Sort was stable, and Quick Sort is unstable.

Why would this property be useful? Is there an issue if this property does not hold good for a sorting algorithm?

In the world of sorting algorithms, stability refers to a special property that some algorithms have. Let's say you have a bunch of numbers to sort, but some of them are the same. Now, if you use a stable sorting algorithm, it will make sure that if two numbers are equal, their order in the sorted list remains the same as in the original list.

Why does this matter? Well, imagine you're sorting a list of students based on their test scores. If two students got the same score, you'd want the sorting algorithm to keep their original order intact. This is where stability comes into play.

Stability can be useful in various situations. For instance, it's handy when you're sorting data based on multiple criteria or when preserving the original order of elements is important. It helps in cases where you're merging sorted lists or when you're dealing with databases and need to maintain consistency.

Now, if a sorting algorithm isn't stable, it means that it might rearrange equal elements during sorting, which could mess up their original order. While this might not be a big deal in some cases, it could lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior in situations where stability is crucial.

So, whether stability matters depends on the specific requirements of your application. If you need to preserve the order of equal elements, then using a stable sorting algorithm is the way to go. Otherwise, an unstable sorting algorithm might still work fine, especially if it offers other advantages like better performance or efficiency.
