# Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might we need to consider in a real-world setting to analyze algorithms? 
Space efficiency is one which refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses to execute. Some algorithms might be fast but consume a lot of memory, which could be a concern, especially in resource-constrained environments. Another one that comes to mind is energy efficiency which refers to the amount of power an algorithm uses during its execution; this is important because devices which algorithms run on have limited battery. Low-energy algorithms are desirable for prolonging battery life and reducing environmental impact.
