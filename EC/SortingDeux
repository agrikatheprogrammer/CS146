Can we use heaps as priority queues? How so? Write an explanation, with the help of pseudocode/diagrams to support your explanation.

Given a max heap, is there a way to use the max heap as a min heap, without writing a whole min heap implementation? Is the opposite also true? Justify your answer with pseudocode, and/or python OR java code, and explain your answer.
