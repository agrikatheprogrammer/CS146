Problem 1:
Let's compare some basic math functions to refresh our memory. For each of the following, just write which function is asymptotically greater (So, you should be thinking about your asymptotic notations!). Show your reasoning for the same.

10000000000n2 vs n3
n2 log(n) vs n(log(n))10
nlogn vs 2
 
2n vs 22n
Problem 2:
Now let's examine some [pseudo]code and apply asymptotic notation to it. 

isPrime(n): 
  for(i = 2, i*i <= n; i++) {
    if(n % i == 0) {
      return false
    }
  return true

What is the 

Best Case
Worst Case
Average Case
Time complexity for the above function?
